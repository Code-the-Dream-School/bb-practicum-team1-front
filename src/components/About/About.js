                ShelfShare is an innovative application that provides a platform
                for sharing books within the community. Our idea originated from
                a desire to enable book lovers to share books easily without the
                hassle of physical visits to libraries or bookstores. With
                ShelfShare, users can search for books they are interested in
                and contact owners for borrowing without leaving their
                communities. <br />
                ShelfShare is not just about convenience; it is also about
                creating a community where people can come together to share
                their love for books. We believe that sharing books can create a
                ripple effect that extends beyond the act of reading. By sharing
                books, we can promote cultural exchange and understanding,
                connect with others in our community, and contribute to
                sustainability by reducing waste and resource consumption.
                <br />
                Additionally, ShelfShare recognizes the unique needs of
                individuals who have limited access to books in their native
                languages, such as refugees and immigrants. Our app provides a
                platform for sharing books in a variety of languages, promoting
                language retention and cultural preservation. <br />
                We believe that everyone should have access to quality reading
                materials regardless of their financial situation. ShelfShare
                offers a cost-effective solution for book enthusiasts to
                exchange books and build a vibrant community around literature.
                Join us in making the world a better place one book at a time
                with ShelfShare.

                            Lara is originally from Indonesia but moved to the
                            San Francisco Bay Area in 2021. She holds a degree
                            in Chemistry and Industrial Engineering which she
                            got in Indonesia but had difficulty finding a job
                            that allowed for flexibility with those degrees here
                            in the U.S. In 2019, Lara became interested in
                            programming, but didn't have access to programming
                            resources with a class setup in her home country
                            until she found CTD, an organization that offers
                            programming courses for immigrants like herself.
                            Through CTD, Lara discovered her love for
                            programming and hopes to create apps that will
                            benefit people in Indonesia. She loves nature, and
                            in her free time, Lara enjoys crocheting, hiking,
                            and traveling with her husband.
