            <p class="about-text">
                One day in my kids daycare I saw a book shelf where parents put
                books to share with other kids. And I liked that idea because
                when you buy book you do not know if your kid would like it or
                not. But when sharing books you can simply return it and take
                another one for free. The only disadvantage was that you need to
                go to daycare to check what books are available. And thats when
                we came up with idea of an application for sharing books that
                would allow to search for books and contact owner without going
                anywhere. The second time when I remembered this idea was when
                in area I live started to come a lot of refugees from Ukrain and
                people from Russia who went out from their home countries to
                save their lives and families. A lot of them arrived in the US
                without a lot of money but with hope that once they could return
                to their countries and make it better. Some of them are older
                people who have kids here and they are not ready to learn new
                languages. So they just need books on their native language to
                read. Some of them are small kids and their parents who just try
                to save native language. And some of them are school age kids
                who continue their education in native country remotely. But
                books in Russian/Ukranian/any other languages are really
                expensive in the US. Not everyone could afford it. Libraries in
                some areas just do not have so many books in foreign languages
                people need. And a lot of newcomes just do not have a car. When
                our multi-national team decided to choose this idea as our
                Practicum project we decided that it would be great not only for
                immigrants from different countries but for everyone who just
                love to read and ready to share have app like this and share
                books easily. So here it is. ShareShelf app welcome you to share
                your books and make this World a bit better!
